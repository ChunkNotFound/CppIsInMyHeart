This is a project of me doing C++ functions for a month, so I can see how I can improve by that time. 
Meanwile I post my coding process on TikTok, so anyone would see how exactly am I doing this.
Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
P.S. I missed the main part of the heart on Valentines Day... I hope the heart will be visible anyway
